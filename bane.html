                    Gather, acolytes, and heed the tale of Darth Bane,<br>
                    the harbinger of our Order’s resurgence. It is through his vision,<br>
                    tempered in the fires of strife and the cold calculus of power,<br>
                    that the Sith endured when all seemed lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the age of the Old Republic, the Sith were legion.<br>
                    We were mighty, our armies vast, yet our strength was our undoing.<br>
                    Pride and ambition untempered by discipline sowed discord within our ranks.<br>
                    The Jedi exploited our fractiousness, and the Sith fell into ruin.<br>
                    Yet, from the ashes of this great collapse,<br>
                    a savior arose—a lone miner named Dessel,<br>
                    born to the harsh mines of Apatros.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dessel's beginnings were wretched, his life a maelstrom of toil and torment.<br>
                    Yet even as a mere man, the Force stirred within him, a tempest bound by flesh.<br>
                    His destiny changed when he was swept into the Sith armies<br>
                    during the Brotherhood of Darkness’ final war against the Jedi.<br>
                    There, he seized his path, rising swiftly in power and cunning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was at the Sith Academy on Korriban that Dessel,<br>
                    now known as Bane, began to grasp the truth.<br>
                    He saw the Brotherhood’s folly—their attempt to subvert<br>
                    the dark side by embracing equality.<br>
                    This betrayal of the Sith’s nature disgusted him.<br>
                    Bane immersed himself in forbidden lore, studying the ancients.<br>
                    From the teachings of Darth Revan,<br>
                    he uncovered the lost essence of our philosophy: power through singularity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His revelation bore fruit at the Battle of Ruusan.<br>
                    The Brotherhood, blinded by their arrogance, sought mutual destruction with the Jedi.<br>
                    Bane, ever the architect of destiny, orchestrated their annihilation.<br>
                    With the creation of the Thought Bomb, a weapon of unimaginable devastation,<br>
                    he purged both the Jedi and the unworthy Sith alike,<br>
                    leaving himself the sole inheritor of the Sith’s mantle.
                </p>
                <p>Thus was born the Rule of Two.<br>
                    Bane understood the Sith's survival required not multitudes but<br>
                    purity—one master to embody the power and one apprentice to crave it.<br>
                    Together, they would hone the dark side to its razor’s edge.<br>
                    Under this doctrine, secrecy replaced armies, patience supplanted haste,<br>
                    and the Sith became the unseen shadow, striking only when the moment was ripe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bane’s legacy did not end with him.<br>
                    Though he faced treachery from his own apprentice, Darth Zannah,<br>
                    as is the way of the Sith, his vision endured.<br>
                    Through countless generations, his successors wove the threads of his grand design,<br>
                    culminating in the rise of Darth Sidious,<br>
                    who brought the Jedi to their knees and established the Sith’s dominion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So remember, acolytes: the Sith did not survive by chance or mercy.<br>
                    It was the vision of Darth Bane, the architect of the Rule of Two,<br>
                    that ensured our Order would rise from ruin to ultimate supremacy.<br>
                    Revere his name, for in his darkness, we found eternal strength.
